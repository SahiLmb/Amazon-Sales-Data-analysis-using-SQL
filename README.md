# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

---

## **Project Overview**

I worked on analyzing a dataset comprising over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. The project involved deep exploration of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. I solved complex SQL problems, such as revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management, showcasing my ability to derive actionable insights.

The project emphasized data cleaning, addressing null values, and tackling real-world business challenges through structured queries. Additionally, an ERD diagram was created to visually illustrate the database schema and the relationships between tables.
